# Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes

This is an implementation of the basic Variational Autoencoder algorithm described in [Kingma and Welling (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), created as partial fulfillment towards the course STA663 (spring 2020). This implementation uses a Gaussian MLP encoder and a Bernoulli MLP decoder, and is set up for data like the MNIST dataset. 

Refer to example file for how to use the package.
